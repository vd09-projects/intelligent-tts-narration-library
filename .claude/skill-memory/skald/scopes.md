# Skald — Scope Registry

```yaml
scopes:
  - slug: cmd-narrate-issue-7
    title: Wire cmd/narrate vertical slice (issue #7)
    created: 2026-06-18
    reasoning: |
      Plan + build + review + iterate + harvest cycle for GitHub issue #7
      (cmd/narrate composition root: cobra CLI + pipeline.Pipeline wiring
      adapter/file + planner + render/sherpa + sink/ephemeral). Issue-numbered
      naming continues the convention.
  - slug: sink-ephemeral-issue-6
    title: Ephemeral OutputSink + sink interface (issue #6)
    created: 2026-06-19
    reasoning: |
      Build + review + iterate cycle for GitHub issue #6 (sink/ interface
      replacing stub + sink/ephemeral concrete impl shelling to afplay).
      Plan was approved out-of-band by user; this scope skips planner-task
      and goes straight to implementation-build. Issue-numbered naming
      continues the convention.
  - slug: render-sherpa-issue-5
    title: Renderer + Kokoro subprocess (issue #5)
    created: 2026-06-18
    reasoning: |
      Plan + build + review + iterate cycle for GitHub issue #5
      (render/render.go interface + render/sherpa/ subprocess backend
      wrapping the existing scripts/kokoro launcher). Issue-numbered
      naming continues the convention.
  - slug: planner-issue-4
    title: planner/ intelligence-light core (issue #4)
    created: 2026-06-18
    reasoning: |
      Plan + build + review + iterate + commit cycle for GitHub issue #4
      (planner core: segment, classify, voice, level, degrade, orchestrator).
      Issue-numbered for parity with adapter-file-issue-3 naming.
  - slug: adapter-file-issue-3
    title: File InputAdapter (issue #3)
    created: 2026-06-18
    reasoning: |
      Review + iterate + commit cycle for GitHub issue #3 (file InputAdapter).
      Slug includes issue number to disambiguate from future adapter-mcptext-issue-N,
      adapter-ocr-issue-N. Kept short.
```
  - slug: cmd-narrate-mcp-issue-12
    title: MCP server cmd/narrate-mcp (issue #12)
    created: 2026-06-19
    reasoning: |
      Plan + build + review + iterate + harvest cycle for GitHub issue #12
      (cmd/narrate-mcp stdio MCP server exposing `speak` tool, wiring the
      same pipeline.Pipeline composition root as cmd/narrate). Issue-numbered
      naming continues the convention.
  - slug: plan-enum-consistency-issue-10
    title: refactor(plan) enum consistency for VoicingDirective + Diagnostic (issue #10)
    created: 2026-06-20
    reasoning: |
      Plan + build + review + iterate + harvest cycle for GitHub issue #10
      (refactor plan/ to lift Diagnostic.Severity, VoicingDirective.SayAs,
      VoicingDirective.Emphasis from freeform strings to typed enum aliases
      with IsValid() — consistency with existing six enums in plan/enums.go).
      Issue-numbered naming continues the convention.
